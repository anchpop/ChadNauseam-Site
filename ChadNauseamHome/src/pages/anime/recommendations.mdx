(This page is mostly a test for a cool technology I just found out about called MDX)

Anime recommendations from ACXD:

- CharlesF:
  - Kimi ni Todoke -- Cute romance/comedy about a gloomy-looking girl
    - High cringe risk
  - teenage pig bunny girl -- monogatari-lite, boy goes around psychoanalyzing girls' problems, mostly conversation
    - Low cringe risk
  - Makoto shinkai -- beautiful movies with great soundtracks, usually drama/romance
    - Low cringe risk
  - Chihayafuru -- Sports shonen in a shoujo art style about people playing slapjack with poetry
    - Orsova says it's "low-cringe"
  - Hakumei to Mikochi -- forest lesbian slice of life
  - Kino's Journey -- androgynous traveler visits countries for three days with talking motorcycle, basically all worldbuilding
  - Majou no Tabi Tabi -- same thing, but with a witch and without a motorcycle
    - High cringe risk
  - Bakemono No Ko -- sword-fighting bears, one of whom has to mature by raising a kid/disciple, who gets a coming of age story
- Orsova:
  - March Comes in like a Lion
    - (heard good things about this one, so has CharlesF)
  - if you want something light, Cells At Work. just a tiny bit of fighting. a greater-than-expected-for-an-anime amount of microbiology
- Paft-dunk:
  - Cromartie High School is a pretty funny gag series about students at a school of "delinquents" (including a robot and a gorilla)
    - Seconded by DFP
- Honourary, strangely for a grizzled military man, suggested Clannad, saying it's a "It's a show about family." and linking [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDxZ0YGWG8) which was cute enough to make a grown woman cry.
