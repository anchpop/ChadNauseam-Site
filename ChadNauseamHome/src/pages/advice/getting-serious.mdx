3. The rest of atomic habits

Most people have goals that they fail to achieve. They know how they want their life to change, but never manage to follow through. They may want:

1. To lose or gain weight

1. To start going to the gym

1. To learn a skill

1. To write a novel

1. To accumulate better friendships

The reason that most people fail at these goals is that they are insufficiently serious.

Which raises an obvious question: **How can you get more serious?**

## Money

Being serious requires at least some disposable income. It doesn't matter how serious you are about going to the gym if you can't afford a gym membership. If you don't have any disposable income, that's the first thing you need to fix.

## Mindset

The first step to being serious is to adjust your mindset. Here's a the process to fix that:

1. Start listening to [Corporate Businesswave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/39pqsBTsb9UNYv1dXbZpff?si=YilIVuUgRxmWjLxsAZfq-w&dl_branch=1&nd=1) on Spotify. This is not a joke. Music has a profound effect on your psyche. You want music that makes you feel like a serious person, that way you become one.

2. Wake up at the same time every day. This is more important than going to sleep at the same time every day. Go into your phone and set an alarm for the time you want to wake up in the morning, then set it to repeat _every single day_, even on the weekends.

   Assuming you have work or school, your weekends are prime time to advance your goals - you can't afford to say you're only serious on weekdays. You're a serious person, that means you're serious every day.

3. If you're a man, shave your face, or take care of your beard (if you have one).

4. Uninstall Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok from your phone. You can still use them, just use the web interface instead of the app. Install the chrome extension [Delay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delay/fbhbfbladmbgakfkccbfjpbabagjcmid?hl=en) on your computer, and add those time-wasting sites. The extension makes you wait for 30 seconds before visitng a site on the blacklist you configure it to use.

   Both of these take advantage of [hyperbolic time discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting) - people value things in the future less than they value them right now, "discounting" their value, but the discount rate isn't linear - going on twitter 1 second from now is much more tempting than going on twitter 30 seconds from now.

5. Accept the hard truth: currently, you spend 100% of your day doing _something_. If you start going to the gym, or learning to play an instrument, or just about anything else, that means **you'll have less time to spend on the stuff you're currently doing**. Hopefully this can be offset by reducing your usage of time-wasting apps in step #4, but it probably won't be completely. Are you willing to make the sacrifice your goals will require? If the answer is no, it just won't work, and that's fine. But if the answer is yes, you will need to internalize that **the sacrifice will _suck_ and that you're going to make it anyway because _you are a serious person_**.

## Goal Setting

Goals are fine, but what you really want are what Scott Adams calls _systems_. For example, let's say your goal is to get physically fit. For this, you might come up with three systems:

1. Go to the gym 6x a week.

2. Eat 100 grams of protein, in addition to a caloric surplus, on gym days.

3. Get 8 hours of sleep a night.

The idea is to have systems that, if you followed them and forgot about your goal, you'd eventually reach your goal anyway. That means you don't need to worry about your goal anymore. Just follow your systems, and you'll get there.

Having a goal means delaying hapiness until you've reached your big milestone. Following systems means you can be happy every day, because all you need to do is follow your systems that day. You can think of it as turing a long-term goal into a goal for each day. That's much more rewarding.

Furthermore, you should try to modify your _self-identity_ to help you stay motivated to your systems. For example, you may change your identity to include that you're "someone who is committed to fitness". Once you've done that, you only need to prove it to yourself. Every time it's raining out, or you're hungover, or you just don't feel like it today, and _you go to the gym anyway_, you're proving that you're committed to fitness. That's something you can take pride in. Most people aren't committed to fitness, but you are!

Take pride in it, and it won't be hard to stick to your systems.

> A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

### Systems In Action

Your systems really start to set in at around your 100th iteration. I write about this in my guide on [how to practice perfectly](https://chadnauseam.substack.com/p/how-to-practice-perfectly).

### Reading

When you take pride in something, you'll want to be doing it or thinking about it all the time. That's good, because we can use that boost your motivation by accelerating your progress.

I write in that guide about how you can improve extremely quickly by just doing something 100 times, and by absorbing the best knowledge from pepole who are better than you. Eventually I'm going to collect all this knowledge in one place for the most common goals, but until then you're going to have to find it on your own. The trick: books. There's so much good information in books. Google `<your interest> book reddit` and find their recommendations.

Download an app called Google Play Books. Think of a book related to the field you're interested in - if you want to become more athletic, it may be [Functional Training For Sports](https://smile.amazon.com/Functional-Training-Sports-Michael-Boyle/dp/1492530611?sa-no-redirect=1). Then find a [Library Genesis](https://libgen.onl/library-genesis/) mirror, search for the book, find an _.epub_ file (_not_ a mobi or .azw or .pdf), pick a mirror and download it (I like the "fast download over IPFS" option). Then go to [play.google.com/books](https://play.google.com/books) and drop the .epub in the window. It will show up on your phone and what page you're on will be synced between your phone and your computer.

(Or you can skip the hassle and just buy the book.)

Try to replace your idle time (twitter, phone games, etc.) with reading something related to your goal. It will keep you passionate and on-track. And it will serve as evidence to convince your subconsious mind that you are really dedicated to your goal. And as said before, it will accelerate your progress, which will boost your motivation further.

## The Field of Latent Potential.

In his book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), James Clear writes about a concept he calls "the field of latent potential".

He uses a metaphor of someone trying to melt an ice cube by warming up a room. If the room is 20° F, the cube will never melt, because the melting point of ice is 32° F. If you raise the temperature to 21° F, it still will not melt (not even a little). You will not _see_ any progress even until you get up to 31° F. But the moment you raise the temperature to 32° F, the ice cube will begin melting. It may feel like you weren't making any progress, but to melt the ice cube you had to raise the temperature of the room from 20° to 32°, and every step in between was contributing to your goal, even if it wasn't visible yet.

You will often have to do something for a long time before you will have an actual achievement to show for it. You will have to work out for some time, maybe 3 months, before people will be able to look at you with your shirt off and tell you're more physically fit than average. But the first three months aren't wasted, they're just building up in the field of latent potential.

## A Little Bit of Slope Makes Up For a Lot Of Y-Intercept

It's unimportant where you are right now. Maybe you can't draw a stick figure or squat the bar. That's actually barely even relevant. Claire from Insightful Life writes that [a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept](https://clairehu.com/2014/02/18/a-little-bit-of-slope-makes-up-for-a-lot-of-y-intercept/). Your trajectory is a lot more important than your current position, and a year is a long time. Most fields have a phenomenon called "noob gains", where once you get over the initial hump, you have so much room to improve at first that your rate of improvement is startling. Make sure you're on the right trajectory and it doesn't really matter where you started.

To be on the right trajectory, you need to make your systems not require willpower or consious effort or motivation. In other words, we need to turn them into habits. There are lots of ways to make something a habit, but the most important is to just do it a lot. The next section describes how to make that happen.

## Okay, Enough With the Motivation Porn

This isn't the first time you've been motivated to do something. People get motivated all the time. Gyms are packed in January and dead by Febuary. Just relying on motivation is not the behavior of a serious person. Not succeeding in your goals would be a disaster. **The path leading to disaster must be averted along every possible point of intervention.** That's why we're going to employ three new strategies.

1. ### Complice

   [Complice](https://complice.co/) is an tool for managing your goals. It costs $15/month, which is not that much in comparison to a lifetime of regret because you never got anything done. There is no cheaper alternative to complice - nothing comes close to it. It has a feature where you can set your new tab page on chrome to your todo list - do that so you don't forget about it. This will prevent you from just forgetting that you're supposed to go to the gym or play guitar, and easily see your trends on a weekly or monthly level.

   It sounds silly, but for me at least, the main reason I start not doing something I've been meaning to do is just becauase it isn't a habit yet and I forget. Even if you don't feel like this is the type of mistake you would make, Complice also has nice built-in features for pomodoro-based time tracking, which I find very helpful for encouraging focused work.

2. ### Beeminder

   [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) is a website/app where you enter what you want to do more of, or what you want to do less of. You enter your progress towards these two goals, and if you do not stay on track, Beeminder will charge you _actual money_ from your credit card.

   "This doesn't feel necessary - I already feel pretty motivated." Everyone says that, then after a couple weeks (or days) they find their motivation exhausted and fall off the wagon. Then they mean to get back on the wagon, but not today, maybe tomorrow, then a year has gone by and they're still no closer to learning to play piano than they started. Besides, if I'm wrong and you're going to stay motivated, that means you'll stay on track and beeminder will never charge you. You can even put yourself on easy mode if you want - if you want to lose 2 pounds/week, tell beeminder that you're going to lose 0.5 pounds/week. That way every week you stick to your _real_ goal, you gain 4 weeks of buffer on beeminder.

   **Seriously, just do it**. You'll always get an email before you get charged in case just forgot to enter in what you did. Beeminder can also connect to Complice, your [Withings smart scale](https://www.withings.com/us/en/scales) (the best smart scale imho), Duolingo, and others, so if your goal can be expressed in one of those then it takes literally no effort to use.

3. ### Boss as a Service

   https://bossasaservice.life/

   I haven't actually used them yet, since most of my goals involve actual bosses, so this section is a WIP.

The most common habitization failure mode is just not doing the thing you want to habitize. **These three interventions will help ensure your systems turn into habits** (and stay that way), by making sure you actually do them. The goal isn's for you to use these for the rest of your life. Instead you're going to use them to give you a push in the direction you want to go until you build your momentum.

## Habitization 101

Habits typically aren't something you really enjoy doing for its own sake (although that doesn't hurt). Instead they're things you're just, well, in the habit of doing. Every day I wake up and brush my teeth, then I brush my teeth after getting ready for bed. I've done that all my life, so it takes no willpower or effort or motivation.

In other words, a habit is a cue followed by a response. The cue is waking up, the response is brushing teeth.

One strategy is to stick a new habit onto an existing one. If your existing habit is drink your morning coffe, you can make that your cue to take a multivitamin.

But that doesn't always work. My habit I've built to become less asocial is, when I hear one of my housemates watching TV downstairs, I go down and join them (even if they're watching a show I'm not interested in).

Think of what cues you can use to remind you to do your systems. For example, used to walk to the store every day, but I wanted to get better at street skating, so now I take my skateboard. Another common one is to do something before sleep - that's when I used to do my Duolingo.

Using those three tools above will help, but you'll have a better experience if you can make your systems into habits, instead of always feeling like you're about to crash into your red line on Beeminder.
