Learning is hard. There are three basic things I want to learn:

1) Technical skills (math, science, music, etc.)

2) Mechanical skills (piano, skateboard tricks, etc.)

3) Advice

In school, we go to a class where we're taught something. Then we take a test, and in many cases that's the last time we ever think about anything we're taught. 

It should be obvious from the fact that you don't remember 90% of what you learned in school that this doesn't really work. But why not? It's tempting to point to one simple reason, but I don't one exists. 

Nobody has an incentive to make school an optimal learning environment. Even college lacks this incentive, because the reason employers value a college degree is because it proves that you were *smart* enough to get in and that you were *conscientious* enough to graduate. The actual skill transfer is relatively unimportant.

Since no one has any incentive to make school an optimal learning environment, we should expect school to *differ* from an optimal learning environment in *many ways*.

And the sad truth is that there's not really much incentive for someone to productize a better learning environment. The most important thing for your value to a company that you're smart, conscientious, and already know how to do the job. So all employers really need to ask for is a college degree and some experience. 

In my case, I graduated from MSU with a degree in game design, but I now work as a cryptocurrency protocol developer. This is a field where most things that sound like they should work, don't, and where any small mistake can cost billions of dollars if it stops the chain. If I'm going to become a good developer, there's a lot I need to learn, so I've put in some thought into how to learn effectively.

## Finding good learning materials

Reading [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/) and watching [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIwxahdLz7bap-VDs9h35A) is fun and there are benefits to making it part of your diet, but things like that in isolation are kind of "for kids". Kids don't have the brain development and prerequisite skills to actually learn complex topics, so popsci articles and YouTube videos are their only option. 

As adults, we can understand the world around us on a much deeper level by learning the material in a more rigourous way. (In general, for technical skills, if you're not doing math you haven't gone rigorous enough.) My favorite way to get a rigorous understanding is to read textbooks. 

A good resource for finding textbooks is the LessWrong page [The Best Textbooks On Every Subject](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject). 

I'm a big textbook fan, but often before reading a textbook I like to familiarize myself with the broad strokes of a subject. Lesswrong has a resource for that too: [The Best Non-Textbooks On Every Subject](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GiEdQ79EDMjggtBKf/best-non-textbooks-on-every-subject).

You can also just google "best <subject> textbook reddit" and "best <subject> textbook hackernews" and get pretty decent results that way too.

## Reinforcing your knowledge with connections

You may have had the same experience I did, where you didn't really learn Algebra 1 until you took Algebra 2, and didn't really learn Algebra 2 until you took Calc 1, etc. 

That's because each class puts the previous class in a new context. 

You might learn about polynomials in Algebra 2, but they have no context in your brain because there's no skills that build on top of them. 

When you learn to find the area under the curve of a polynomial in Calc 1, suddenly your conception of what a polynomial is becomes crystal clear. 

That's my experience anyway.


Something similar happens when you try to learn the same material from multiple sources at once. 

The same information is presented in different ways, and the feeling of drawing connections between the different presentations feels good.

It's also good to draw connections between different fields. This is especially useful for math and the sciences. If you're learning Calc, you should be reading a Calc-based physics textbook at the same time. 

Calculus was invented to study physics, and if you only ever took a physics class that didn't make use of calculus you missed out on a whole world of elegant equations. The simplest is that the derivative of position is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. Therefore acceleration is the second derivative of position.

What's that mean? Well, take Newton's second law: the second derivative of an object's position depends only on the object's mass and the forces acting on it. Doesn't it invite questions? Why the second derivative, and not the first or the third? In fact, it was that question that Aristotle got wrong when he said the *speed* of a falling object is *constant* and proportional to the object's weight. He was mistakenly saying that forces and mass affect the first derivative of an object's position, rather than the second. 

But we should give Aristotle some credit. For objects moving in fluids (for example, air), Aristotelian physics is not half bad! Objects will naturally come to rest when no forces are applied, because of friction with the fluid. And if you apply a force to an object, it will speed up, but the opposing force of friction will increase with the square of the velocity until it eventually perfectly balances out. So in a fluid, it really seems like forces act on the first derivative of position, rather than the second!.

My goal there was to draw some connections between a variety of topics to cement some information into your mind. It's probably information you already had, but hopefully you get the idea. A rich tapestry of information is much easier to retain than the same amount of information without context, so search for connections whenever you can.

In fact, this ability to draw connections is why learning math is so overpowered. You can tell the difference between someone who learned a lot of math just for math's sake, and someone who only learned what math they needed to get by. The one who learned math for math's sake will be able to understand a novel concept much more quickly, because odds are it'll be related to some math concept they already understand.
