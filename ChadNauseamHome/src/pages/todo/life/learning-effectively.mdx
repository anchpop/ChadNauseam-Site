Learning is hard. There are three basic things I want to learn:

1) Technical skills (math, science, music, etc.)

2) Mechanical skills (piano, skateboard tricks, etc.)

3) Advice

In school, we go to a class where we're taught something. Then we take a test, and in many cases that's the last time we ever think about anything we're taught. 

It should be obvious from the fact that you don't remember 90% of what you learned in school that this doesn't really work. But why not? It's tempting to point to one simple reason, but I don't one exists. 

Nobody has an incentive to make school an optimal learning environment. Even college lacks this incentive, because the reason employers value a college degree is because it proves that you were *smart* enough to get in and that you were *conscientious* enough to graduate. The actual skill transfer is relatively unimportant.

Since no one has any incentive to make school an optimal learning environment, we should expect school to *differ* from an optimal learning environment in *many ways*.

And the sad truth is that there's not really much incentive for someone to productize a better learning environment. The most important thing for your value to a company that you're smart, conscientious, and already know how to do the job. So all employers really need to ask for is a college degree and some experience. 

In my case, I graduated from MSU with a degree in game design, but I now work as a cryptocurrency protocol developer. This is a field where most things that sound like they should work, don't, and where any small mistake can cost billions of dollars if it stops the chain. If I'm going to become a good developer, there's a lot I need to learn, so I've put in some thought into how to learn effectively.
