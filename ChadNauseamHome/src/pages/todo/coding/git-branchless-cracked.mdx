`git-branchless` adds a bunch of commands to git that make it a real joy to use. The best one is [`git undo`](https://blog.waleedkhan.name/git-undo/), which just undoes whatever you just did. The blog post says:

> For example, it can undo bad merges and rebases with ease, and there are even some rare operations that git undo can undo [which canâ€™t be undone with `git reflog`](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Architecture#comparison-with-the-reflog). 

What a great idea. 

## A brief note on installation

The official installation page is [here](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Installation), but I'll restate it briefly here. Assuming you have cargo, installation is just one `cargo install --locked git-branchless` away. If you use nix like me (which you should!), you can also install `git-branchless` [that way](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=22.05&show=git-branchless&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=git-branchless).

Once you have it installed, you need to run `git branchless init` inside a git repo, and `git-branchless` will be set up for that clone of that repo.

You should also set up this alias:

```
# git-branchless
git = "git-branchless wrap --";
```

If you already have git aliases, you probably want to add `git-branchless wrap --` to them. These are the aliases I use:

```
# git aliases
# standard git
gs = "git-branchless wrap -- status";
gp = "git-branchless wrap -- push";
gpf = "git-branchless wrap -- push --force-with-lease";
# git-branchless
gsync = "git-branchless sync";
gbinit = "git-branchless init";
gsl = "git sl";
gamend = "git-branchless amend";
greword = "git-branchless reword";
```

## What you can do with `git-branchless`

1. My most used command is probably `git sync`. This tries to find the `master` branch (or the `main` branch, etc.) in your repo, and rebases your so all the new commits are on top of the commits in the master branch. 

   Note that it won't pull changes from origin or anything like that, so make sure to pull on the master branch first if that's what you want.

   Also, the git-branchless implementation of rebasing is way faster than the stock one! It will also abort without doing anything if the rebase requires merge conflict resolution, so you can run `git sync` without fear of being stuck in a weird merge conflict. 
   
   If you're okay with fixing the conflicts, run `git sync -m`.
