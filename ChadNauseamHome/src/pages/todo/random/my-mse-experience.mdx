## My Expansion:

My upper jaw went from looking like this:

To this:

<CenteredImg src={upper_jaw_post_expansion} />

## What is MSE?

An MSE appliance is looks like this:

<CenteredImg src={mse_hero} />

It's a type of expander. Specifically, it's a bone-bourne expander. The bits that attach to your molars are flexible and don't push on your teeth, the only reason they're there is to keep the expander from rotating inside your mouth. The expander is anchored to your mouth via the four screws in the middle. Every day, you use a small wrench to rotate the nut in the middle of the expander, which forces the expander to push outward horizontally, applying pressure to the bone (called the maxilla).

(You may be familiar with tooth-borne expanders that they often give to kids. Those are great, but don't work on adults because our bones are too sturdy. so the expander will just tip the teeth.)

If all goes well, after a few days of expanding the "suture" at the top of your mouth will split. That allows the two halves of your upper jaw to move independently. After you're done expanding, you leave the appliance in there for a few months to hold it steady while the gap fills in with new bone.

I got my expander when I had just turned 22, and got it removed the other day. I genuinely think getting an expander was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

## The downsides

1. **Cost**: Getting the expander installed isn't cheap, and then you need invisalign to fix the giant gap it'll leave in your front teeth. For me the total cost came to around $10k.

2. **Discomfort**: Having a giant appliance in your mouth isn't pleasant. Food gets caught in it all the time, and the screws scrape up your tongue until it feels like ground beef.

3. **Complications**: It's possible that your suture won't split, or that you'll develop facial asymmetry where one half expands more than the other, or that you'll experience "screw drag" where the screws drag through your bone instead of your bone moving with the screws. I actually had some minor screw drag and it was pretty painful.

## The upsides

I got MSE for two reasons:

1. **Improved breathing**: I had a problem with snoring. MSE makes your airway bigger and is an effective treatment for sleep apnea. I have no data to confirm this, but I'm told I no longer snore and my chronic fatigue has completely gone away.

2. **More tongue space**: I have a tongue tie which my orthodontist thinks is preventing me from speaking properly. For as long as I can remember, people have told me to "stop mumbling" and "open your mouth when you talk", but I haven't been able to figure out how to talk clearly. Pre-MSE, my tongue couldn't fit inside the roof of my mouth, but now that that's resolved I feel I already speak more clearly â€“ once I get my tongue tie cut I hope that I'll see further improvement.

There's one other benefit I wasn't expecting. I feel that MSE has substantially improved my facial aesthetics. I've always been insecure about my smile, thinking it looks "weird" without being able to put my finger on why.

Since MSE, my smile has obviously gotten much wider. Also, even when I'm not showing my teeth, I feel like you can see a difference in my cheekbones.

And of course, here's the obligatory gap pic:
