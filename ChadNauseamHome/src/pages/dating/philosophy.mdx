(Context: this post is aimed at straight, 18-24 year old men in the US.)

Most dating advice aimed at young men is full of "tricks" - ways you can make women think you have more options than you really do. Things like "don't text back too quickly" or "don't come off as desperate" or "don't apologize too much". These things probably help, but they're not what you should be focusing on. Quote I heard from a bodybuilder:

> Everybody wants to look like they can bench 225. Being able to bench 225 really helps.

Men with a lot of options have different behavior than everyone else, because they have different incentives. These tricks are ways to simulate the behavior of someone who has a lot of options, as a way of increasing your status (more on that later). If you really have a lot of options, you won't have to worry about these tricks, because it'll be obvious from your behavior.

So how do you get a lot of options? You just have to be attractive to the type of women you want to date. There's a very simple formula that determines how attractive you are to women:

<BlockMath math="\text{Attractiveness} = \text{Hotness} \times \text{Status} \times \text{Social dominance}" />

(Constant factors omitted. More elaboration on all these factors later. )

Dating is a competition - everyone wants the best partner they can get, so you're inevitably going to be ranked against everyone else. Don't believe me? Consider that in the 1600s, everyone was malnourished and no one ever brushed their teeth, bathed, or got a professional haircut. Anyone from the 21st century would be a god among men just for having all their teeth. But since just about everyone in the present day has all their teeth, you don't get any points for it. That means the best way to think of these factors is in terms of percentiles. We'll call them _stats_, between 1 and 100. Your stats on their own won't determine your dating success, though. Your dating success depends on one more factor:

<BlockMath math="\text{Dating success} = \text{Attractiveness} \times \text{Interactions with women}" />

If you never interact with women, you'll obviously never date one. If you're at 50s for each of those stats, and you have a decent number of interactions with women, you should not have a problem dating. If you're reading this blog, you probably are in desperate need of boosting at least one of them. Having a zero in any of those stats is like a dating death sentence (with social dominance probably being the least important).

So, which factors should you boost? Well, your priority should be whichever you're the lowest in. The good news is that there are strategies that boost multiple factors at once. These are where you're likely to get the most bang for your buck.

## What do women want?

Women are basically unified in wanting one thing: an "equal".

Women generally don't want to be with anyone she thinks couldn't land someone else as "good" as her. This is one reason those "tricks" to make it seem like you have a lot of options are helpful. This is why confidence is attractive and insecurity is unattractive. One of my friends calls this her "Groucho Marx model of dating" - when she finds out someone is interested in her, she becomes less attracted to them, because she sees it an indication that they couldn't do any better. Aella points at this too - she wants someone who's drawn to her due to "unusual compatibility", effectively giving them a reason for being interested in her besides not being able to get anyone else "on her level".

Not every woman is like this, and the ones who are have other criteria too, but this is an important factor you should be aware of.

## Interactions with women

"Interaction" means more than "we made eye contact in the hallway". You actually have to have some form of conversation.

This is the easiest factor to boost, partially because it's the only one where you aren't implicitly competing with everyone else. Doubling the number of new (to you) women a year you interact with, will double the number of potential chances you have to get into a relationship. It's actually even better than that if you're socially awkward around women, because the more women you interact with the less socially awkward you'll feel when you meet a new one.

If you want to interact with a lot of women you have to go where the women are, even if that's not really where you want to spend your time.

1.  If you're a college student, the #1 best thing you can do is join a frat. Unfortunately, if you're reading this, there's a good chance you wouldn't be let into any frat worth joining. (Sorry.)

1.  The next best thing is a housing co-op program. They typically accept anyone who wants to join, and you'll live in a house with 15-30 other people. You probably shouldn't date anyone in your house, but your house will have parties or social events with other houses that you can go to. Moving into a co-op will come up a lot here, because it's beneficial across multiple categories.

1.  Failing that, you can go to clubs. Find something you find interesting that has a decent number of women in it (at least 50%). Good options are things like "outdoors club", breakdancing club, and clubs focused on humanitarian or environmental causes. If you're in college, see if your university has a directory of clubs and write down 10 or so you'd be interested in joining.

    Side note, don't join a humanitarian or environmental cause if it's not actually something you care about. People will probably be able to tell, so you won't get much out of it.

1.  If you're in a reasonably populated area: online dating.

    Tinder is the name of the game here, even if you're only interested in long-term relationships. Don't bother with any other platform. It kind of sucks, but it sucks more if you don't get any matches. To get matches, you need good pictures. [Vlad Loweren is a gigachad anyway, but he has pretty good advice on how to get goodpictures](https://www.see-elegance.com/post/its-not-you-its-your-photos). It boils down to: hire a photographer to take some pictures of you (search #citynamephotographer on Instagram for cheap independent photographers), dress reasonably well (more on this later), and "squinch" your eyes.

    > [S]quinching isn’t the same as squinting! The difference is minor but important. When you squint, your top and bottom eyelids close up and your eyes end up all but disappearing — you look neither confident nor self-assured.
    >
    > With ‘squinching,’ you’re lifting and tightening the lower eyelid, while only letting the top one come down a hair. It might seem like a slight difference (and it is) but it’s a big deal when you get in front of the camera.

    <Note>
      Also, suck your tongue onto the roof of your mouth. Try it in a mirror and
      notice how it sucks in the skin that connects to your neck under your head
      - it'll make your jawline look more defined.
    </Note>

    On tinder, your goal should be to move the conversation off Tinder ASAP
    (within the first 5-10 messages). Once you've done that you want to organize
    an in-person hangout in the next 20 messages or so, scheduled as soon as
    possible (definitely within a week). If you can't hang out in the next week,
    stay off Tinder. Every message you send is a little bit of potential
    attraction that's dwindling away.

1.  Try the gym. If you go to the gym frequently enough, you'll start to notice other regulars and become friends with some. Many relationships start from meeting people in the gym. Don't hit on everyone you meet there, just try to be friendly and treat women the same way you'd treat men. If you make enough friends, probably one of them will be attracted to you. A later section will describe how to turn this into more than just a friendship.

## Hotness

First, some theory. Dating is a market, so you need to know about supply and demand. This means you should ignore what any individual person tells you about their preferences, because that only tells you about the demand side. Imagine 50% of women dislike blue eyes, and 50% like them. Only 20% of Americans have blue eyes, so the supply for blue eyes doesn't come close to meeting the demand. Since attractiveness is relative, this means having blue eyes is an advantage.

### Hair

The easiest thing to do is pick a good hairstyle. The most important thing is that your hairstyle looks intentional, not like you just go to supercuts and ask for "the usual". You have a few options:

1. Long hair, in a man-bun or ponytail:

   <img src={man_bun} style={{ borderRadius: 15 }} />

   This looks good with most hairlines and face-shapes.

1. If your hair sticks up naturally, or if you're okay with styling it, you can try short-on-sides long-on-top.

   <img src={short_sides_long_top} style={{ borderRadius: 15 }} />

   It helps to have a decent hairline with this one. It looks a little british/european, but that's okay. You can also grow out the top and tie it in the back like a man-bun.

1. If you want to look more masculine, buzzing your head is always in style and shouldn't be discounted. If you have short hair, I recommend just buying some clippers and trying it out. You might find you like it.

   <img src={buzzed_head} style={{ borderRadius: 15 }} />

   This obviously looks good with any hairline. You don't need to be able to grow a beard, either.

1. Lastly, curtains. This is kind of an eboy look, and requires the most maintenance and best hairline genes, but it looks really good:

   <img src={curtain_hairstyle_men} style={{ borderRadius: 15 }} />

   (Wavy hair optional - see Keanu Reeves.)

### Face

The most important thing you can do for your face, besides your haircut, is lose fat. Even if you're not overweight, fat clumps on your face and makes you look less "chisled". There's diminishing returns after a certain point, but unless you're very muscular you should try to be in the bottom half of the healthy weight range for your BMI.

### Body

Lose weight and hit the gym. You only need to work out for 3-6 months to start seeing results in your level of muscularity. (Julian Shapiro)[https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/intro] has an extensive guide. If you're not reasonably skinny and you can't do 5 good pull-ups, you're not setting yourself up for dating success.

<img src={muscle_target} />

And as we'll discuss soon, being fit will make your clothes fit better and all your other choices look more intentional by association.

### Fashion

The easiest way to have passable fashion is to have an attractive fashion-conscious female friend dress you. (Not your mom, by the way.) You're probably going to have to spend some money - budget $500 - $1000. Dressing fashionably can be cheap, and it can be easy, but it can never be both. (If it were, everybody would be fashionable, and then what was "fashionable" would change.)

The second easiest way is to subscribe to an automatic clothing-box service like [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/). I've used them and generally been pretty happy with the results. You can return clothes you don't like, but still expect to pay a premium.

Also, it's much easier to be perceived as fashionable if you're skinny. Clothes will fit you better and you'll look better in them. And if you're muscular (maybe at the level of Joey from friends), anything you wear will fit you well and be perceived as fashionable.

## Status

This really boils down to two things: **Women don't like dating guys who have no options**, and **people don't like being friends with people who have no friends**.

Status is the only factors that has a self-reinforcing center-squeeze effect. It's the cause of the power-law distribution we see in dating success. Having no friends and no dating prospects is a stable equilibrium.

Women want their friends to be impressed by you. <Note>This is why the notion of "conventionally attractive" is so important - it's a shorthand for what's the most generically-impressive.</Note> She doesn't want them to think you're gross, even if she thinks you're the hottest thing to walk the earth.

(Back in my freshman year when I was completely manipulative and girl-crazy, I deliberately kept snapchat streaks with many women, so when I opened my snapchat in front of someone I was interested in they would see I wasn't just talking to them. More than one person later mentioned noticing my snapchat streaks, so it seemed to be doing something.)

But there's more to status than that. When you join a club, you'll probably be low-status within the club. But as you work your way up to an authority position, your status will raise with it and you'll have a much easier time dating others in the club. Someone who has a lot of friends, especially female friends, is higher status than someone who doesn't. (You can also date your friends' friends, and being a friend's friend gives you an automatic status boost. This is why women putting you in "the friendzone" is never a bad thing - they're still raising your status by being friends with you, and you can date their friends too.)

Your main issue will be that people you meet will naturally stay in the "acquaintance" category rather than automatically moving into the "friends" category. I call this the "secondary location" problem. You might be friends with your outdoors-club friends when you're in outdoors-club, but you're nothing outside of that. Don't leave it to chance - you need a plan for turning "friends" into friends.

The easiest solution is to organize regular dinner parties, game nights, videogame nights, bar crawls, etc. <Note>Bonus: having a lot of friends makes you higher-status, but when you're at an event _you organized_ (especially if it's in your house), you're automatically the highest-status person there. It's not healthy to constantly obsess over status, but it's worth having in mind.</Note> The key is for them to be _regular_. This makes it super easy to invite people of any sex without it feeling like a creepy overstep. If you host a dinner party every sunday, and your friends all bring a friend, and you run into someone in outdoors club who you like, you can just invite them without it being a big thing. If they come, you'll have broken the secondary-location barrier and be much closer to becoming genuine friends with them.
