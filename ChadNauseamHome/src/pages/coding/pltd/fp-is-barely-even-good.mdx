When you think about functional programming, you might think of banning mutation, or of functions without side effects. But in my opinion, the fundamental idea of FP is _equational reasoning_. That is, this code:

```
x = foo()
y = bar(x)
z = bar(x)
```

Should mean the same thing as:

```
y = bar(foo())
z = bar(foo())
```

If you write `x = foo()`, that means you should be able to replace any occurrence of `x` with `foo()` without changing the meaning.

Everything else follows from this idea.

1. If `foo()` had side effects, then the first example (where we call `foo` once) would have different behavior than the second (where we call it twice).

2. If `bar(x)` could mutate `x`, then changing `bar(x)` to `bar(foo())` would change what your program means.

By saying reducing what you can do, we allow a way of reasoning about programs that would otherwise be basically impossible. Math traditionally uses equational reasoning a lot, and not for nothing â€“ it's really useful!

## Can we still have effectful programs?
