1. Wifi

   1. When a device logs in to a wifi network for the first time, it should negotiate a keypair with the router that will remain valid when the SSID or password changes.

   1. For home routers, you should be able to get to the "edit ssid/password" page by scanning a qr code on the router, with no authentication or 192.168.1.1 business. Anyone with physical access to the router can do this anyway by pressing the reset button so there's no security loss here.

   1. When a device is trying to log into a wifi network, it should broadcast a "wifi credentials please" signal, and nearby devices should display a popup that says "this device is trying to log into your wifi, let it on?". If they accept, the device receives a key that gives it access to the network.
