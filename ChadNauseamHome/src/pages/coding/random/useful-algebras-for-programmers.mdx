## The Tile Algebra

> An algebra of pictures is described that is sufficiently powerful to denote the structure of a well-known Escher woodcut, Square Limit. A decomposition of the picture that is reasonably faithful to Escher's original design is given. This illustrates how a suitably chosen algebraic specification can be both a clear description and a practical implementation method. It also allows us to address some of the criteria that make a good algebraic description.

This isn't a super useful algebra, but I'm putting it here because it was my first and you should always remember your first algebra.

## The Graph Algebra

[Alga](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga)

> **Alga** is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs in Haskell. See [this Haskell Symposium paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper) and the corresponding [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdQGLewU-8k) for the motivation behind the library, the underlying theory and implementation details. There is also a [Haskell eXchange talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10635-algebraic-graphs), and a [tutorial](https://nobrakal.github.io/alga-tutorial) by Alexandre Moine.

The basic idea is to represent graphs with the following algebra:

```haskell
data Graph a = Empty | Vertex a | Overlay (Graph a) (Graph a) | Connect (Graph a) (Graph a)
```

Which gives you all kinds of nice laws.

> Here Empty and Vertex construct the empty and single-vertex graphs, respectively; Overlay composes two graphs by taking the union of their vertices and edges, and Connect is similar to Overlay but also creates edges between vertices of the two graphs [...]. The overlay and connect operations have two important properties: (i) they are closed on the set of graphs, i.e. are total functions, and (ii) they can be used to construct any graph starting from the empty and single-vertex graphs. For example, Connect (Vertex 1) (Vertex 2) is the graph with two vertices {1, 2} and a single edge (1, 2). Malformed graphs, such as G [1] [(1,2)], cannot be expressed in this core language.
