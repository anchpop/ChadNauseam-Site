  subtitle="Why we should have a programmer union"
  description="I think a programmer union would plausibly be good for everyone">

First, let me be clear and say that I am _not_ arguing for company-specific unions. A company-specific union mostly exists to allow the employees to collectively bargain, for higher wages or things like that. I'm arguing for a sectoral union - a union that every programmer in the country would belong to. These are the three goals I have for this union:

1. Virtually no bureaucracy or overhead.

2. Increase programmer pay.

3. Increase corporation revenue.

4. Minimal union dues (likely 1% of income).

Programmers are unlike nearly any job, because we can make tools that recursively improve our productivity. We started out with machine code, then we made assembly, then we used assembly to write programming languages, then we used programming languages to write IDEs and LSPs and static analyzers, etc. This has enabled us to become extremely productive, which is part of why we're so highly paid.

Things like better programming languages and tooling help everyone. But they're _non-rivalrous_ and (due to the programmer preference for open-source) relatively _non-excludable_. These combine to make programmer tooling a _public good_. (i.e. a good that is consumed by the public).

## A Molochian Force

(This section explains the consequences of something being a public good, feel free to skip if you already know.)

There is an interesting idea in evolutionary biology, that says that evolution selects for traits based on their _relative fitness_, rather than their absolute fitness. In the words of [Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XC7Kry5q6CD9TyG4K/no-evolutions-for-corporations-or-nanodevices):

> This means that if a Frodo gene saves its whole species from extinction, the average Frodo characteristic does not increase, since Frodo's act benefited all genotypes equally and did not _covary_ with _relative_ fitness.

> It is said that Price became so disturbed with the implications of his equation for altruism that he committed suicide, though he may have had other issues. (Overcoming Bias does not advocate committing suicide after studying Price's Equation.)

Genes that help everyone aren't selected for. Something similar happens with corporation (although corporations don't really evolve so it's not a direct parallel). In fact, this quirk of evolution is nearly a special case of the public good problem from economics. Quoting [Vitalik](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/underproduced-compared-to-what-e2c2190e53c9):

> The reason why public goods are underproduced is that anyone paying for a public good, by increasing the level of production of that public good, is benefiting N people, but is only themselves getting 1/N of that benefit. Ergo self-interested individuals will only contribute to public goods whose benefit/cost ratio is greater than N:1. Itâ€™s a tragedy of the commons scenario.

The issue that I am trying to point out is that programmer tooling incredibly obviously underproduced because it is a public good.

The counterargument to this is "well, someone should write a tool and sell it, and if it improves programmer productivity then companies will buy it and they'll make lots of money". For whatever reason this doesn't seem to work very well. Many new mainstream languages like Rust and Go are financed my large corporations that felt like they personally had a lot to gain from the creation of the language - and when Mozilla stopped feeling like it was benefitting that much from Rust development, they sacked half the Rust team, even though Rust development was definitely positive for programmers as a whole. <Note>Microsoft probably makes money from Github, and Jetbrains exists, but they're exceptions to the general rule of "programmer tooling isn't a profit center".</Note>

### How Sectoral Unions Can Solve This

Here's my suggestion. We make a union. Any programmer can tell the union "I'd like to join". The list of people who have said this is kept secret. Once over 66% of programmers at a company have said they'd like to join, a vote for unionization is automatically triggered. (And it will obviously pass, because such votes only need 50%+1 votes for the government to force them to unionize, and 66% of employees have already expressed that they'd like to join the union.)

Okay, but what are the consequences of unionization?

1. All employees are compelled to join the union, which means they pay 0.5% of their income to the union as dues.

2. The company is now legally able to use code that's been licensed open-source-for-union-companies, if someone for some reason wrote code with that license.

Ok, but how is all that money going to be spent? Simple. Programmers can donate money, out of their own pockets, to anyone they want. In return, the union will "match" their donation according to [this design](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656).

> Citizens make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received. Under the "standard model" this yields first best public goods provision. Variations [of this design] can limit the cost, help protect against collusion and aid coordination.

This matching system has several nice properties.

1. It doesn't need any complicated bureaucracy to decide where the money goes. Instead, the union's money goes only to where _each individual programmer_ is willing to put their personal money. I imagine these would likely be programming projects, but they could be whatever you want. (Givewell, the EFF, Blender, etc.)

2. It actually does a good job at deciding where the money goes. Because programmers have to spend their own money to have the union fund "match" it, they probably won't donate money trivially. And the peculiar matching algorithm I mentioned has the nice property that it rewards projects in proportion to how big the donations are _and_ how many different people are donating.

Previously I mentioned a new license: open-source-for-union-companies. If someone wanted to write code with this license, they could, and then only individuals and union companies could use it. No one would have an incentive to license code this way, unless they think that licensing their code that way would make union members more likely to donate to them, but nobody really has an incentive to license their code for open-source anyway.

The interesting thing is that, if being able to use code with this license made programmers more than 0.5% more productive, it would be in every company's financial self-interest to immediately unionize.

To enforce the license, union members could contribute to a "union legal defense fund", and these contributions would be matched from the subsidy pool, the same as any other project.

Some amount would have to be spent on the tooling to automatically record contributions and pay creators from the subsidy pool. This would have to be bootstrapped with some seed money, then could be funded in the same way as the legal defense fund.
