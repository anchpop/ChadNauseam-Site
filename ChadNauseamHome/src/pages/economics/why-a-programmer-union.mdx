  subtitle="A Programmer Union Can Save Open Source"
  description="I think a programmer union would plausibly be good for everyone">

First, let me be clear and say that I am _not_ arguing for company-specific unions. A company-specific union mostly exists to allow the employees to collectively bargain, for higher wages or things like that. I'm arguing for a sectoral union - a union that every programmer in the country would belong to. These are the three goals I have for this union:

1. Virtually no bureaucracy or overhead.

2. Increase programmer pay.

3. Increase corporation revenue.

4. Minimal union dues (likely 1% of income).

Programmers are unlike nearly any job, because we can make tools that recursively improve our productivity. We started out with machine code, then we made assembly, then we used assembly to write programming languages, then we used programming languages to write IDEs and LSPs and static analyzers, etc. This has enabled us to become extremely productive, which is part of why we're so highly paid.

Things like better programming languages and tooling help everyone. But they're _non-rivalrous_ and (due to the programmer preference for open-source) relatively _non-excludable_. These combine to make programmer tooling a _public good_. (i.e. a good that is consumed by the public).

## A Molochian Force

(This section explains the consequences of something being a public good, feel free to skip if you already know.)

There is an interesting idea in evolutionary biology, that says that evolution selects for traits based on their _relative fitness_, rather than their absolute fitness. In the words of [Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XC7Kry5q6CD9TyG4K/no-evolutions-for-corporations-or-nanodevices):

> This means that if a Frodo gene saves its whole species from extinction, the average Frodo characteristic does not increase, since Frodo's act benefited all genotypes equally and did not _covary_ with _relative_ fitness.
>
> It is said that Price became so disturbed with the implications of his equation for altruism that he committed suicide, though he may have had other issues. (Overcoming Bias does not advocate committing suicide after studying Price's Equation.)

Genes that help everyone aren't selected for. Something similar happens with corporation (although corporations don't really evolve so it's not a direct parallel). In fact, this quirk of evolution is nearly a special case of the public good problem from economics. Quoting [Vitalik](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/underproduced-compared-to-what-e2c2190e53c9):

> The reason why public goods are underproduced is that anyone paying for a public good, by increasing the level of production of that public good, is benefiting N people, but is only themselves getting 1/N of that benefit. Ergo self-interested individuals will only contribute to public goods whose benefit/cost ratio is greater than N:1. Itâ€™s a tragedy of the commons scenario.

The issue that I am trying to point out is that programmer tooling incredibly obviously underproduced because it is a public good.

The counterargument to this is "well, someone should write a tool and sell it, and if it improves programmer productivity then companies will buy it and they'll make lots of money". For whatever reason this doesn't seem to work very well. Many new mainstream languages like Rust and Go are financed my large corporations that felt like they personally had a lot to gain from the creation of the language - and when Mozilla stopped feeling like it was benefitting that much from Rust development, they sacked half the Rust team, even though Rust development was definitely positive for programmers as a whole. <Note>Microsoft probably makes money from Github, and Jetbrains exists, but they're exceptions to the general rule of "programmer tooling isn't a profit center".</Note>

### How Sectoral Unions Can Solve This

Here's my suggestion. We make a union. Anyone can tell the union "I'd like to join". <Note>The list of people who have said this is kept secret.</Note> Once over 66% of employees at a company have said they'd like to join, a vote for unionization is automatically triggered. (And it will obviously pass, because such votes only need 50%+1 votes for the government to force them to unionize, and 66% of employees have already expressed that they'd like to join the union.)

Okay, but what are the consequences of unionization?

1. All employees are compelled to join the union, which means they pay 1% of their income to the union as dues.

2. The company is now legally able to use code that's been licensed as union-only, if someone for some reason wrote code with that license.

Ok, but how is all that money going to be spent? Simple. Programmers can donate money, out of their own pockets, to anyone they want. In return, the union will use dues as a subsidy pool, to "match" their donation according to [this design](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656).

> Citizens make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received. Under the "standard model" this yields first best public goods provision. Variations [of this design] can limit the cost, help protect against collusion and aid coordination.

This matching system has several nice properties.

1. It doesn't need any complicated bureaucracy to decide where the money goes. Instead, the union's money goes only to where _each individual programmer_ is willing to put their personal money. I imagine these would likely be programming projects, but they could be whatever you want. (Givewell, the EFF, Blender, etc.)

2. It actually does a good job at deciding where the money goes. Because programmers have to spend their own money to have the union fund "match" it, they probably won't donate money trivially. And the peculiar matching algorithm I mentioned has the nice property that it rewards projects in proportion to how big the donations are _and_ how many different people are donating.

### Sounds nice, but how can we actually make it happen?

I actually have a very pleasing design for a positive feedback loop that would lead to wide adoption of the union, once we get it started! Here's how it works:

I mentioned before that we'd introduce a way to license code as union-only. Specifically, I suggest that we make a new "UGPL" license, which permits anything that would be permitted by the GPL _and_ lets union companies do whatever they want.

It's obvious that if there's a lot of code licensed under UGPL, companies may benefit from unionizing (so they could use the code without having to follow the GPL's restrictions). How much the benefit is dependent on the amount of UGPL code in existence.

Here's the feedback loop: we set put some money from union dues (let's say 25%) into a separate subsidy pool. This pool is reserved for donations to UGPL-licensed projects. So if there's initially no UGPL-licensed projects, the first person who writes one and gets a donation would receive the entire subsidy pool. This would create a huge incentive for people to license their code as UGPL. <Note>All UGPL code can be used by GPL projects, since it's like a dual-license</Note>

This creates a pretty nice feedback loop - the more companies join the union, the more money goes to UGPL projects. The more UGPL projects, the greater the incentive is to join the union.

The most elegant part about this is that it would also make the GPL much more attractive. Any popular GPL project can now get a ton of cash from the union, in exchange for granting the union a permissive license.

### How much bureaucracy?

First of all, we'd need lawyers to enforce the UGPL. But I don't think of this as "bureaucracy" - we can just have the union's legal defense fund be a project that union members can contribute to. Then those contributions would be matched from the subsidy pool the same as any other project.

It's a similar story for the tooling to automatically record contributions and pay creators from the subsidy pool. Once bootstrapped with some seed money, this could be funded the same way as the legal defense fund.

These are the decisions the union would have to make:

1. Setting union dues.

2. Setting the size of the smaller subsidy-pool for union-licensed code.

Since there's so few decisions to make, you wouldn't need any complicated union leadership election process or anything like that. There could just be an annual vote on what these numbers should be.

### Everyone wins

The best part about this union is that nobody loses. Companies get more productive programmers, programmers get better libraries and tooling, and projects that programmers are interested in get money to finance development. What's not to like?
