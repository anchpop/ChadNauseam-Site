Music came before art and language. 
It's one of the most ancient parts of our psyche.
So how sad is it that most people only sing in the shower, if they sing at all?

When you turn on the radio, you hear some of the most optimized songs ever made.
They're catchy, they're fun, they're easy to sing along to.
The person singing them probably is attractive and has a nice voice.

When faced by the sheer optimality of these songs, I thought "I can't sing".
I thought I wasn't born with the gift of music. 

It wasn't just music either. 
Multiple times I bought a sketchbook or downloaded zbrush, but I seemed to have some kind of innate anti-talent for anything artistic.
The only thing I knew I was good at was programming, and programming is fun, so I dove into that instead.

I read an apocryphal story, about an exchange Arthur Eddington supposedly had after he discovered that stars are powered by fusion reactions:

> He recounted how, on the night after his discovery, he was sitting on a bench with his girlfriend. She said, "Aren't the stars so pretty tonight?" To which he replied, "Yes, and right now, I'm the only one in the world who knows why they shine."

I've often thought about what it must feel like, to have seen into reality so deeply that you know something that no one else does.
I think it must be a trancendent. 
I never really thought that feeling would be mine, but I still dreamed of having that feeling myself one day. 
Those faded when I went to college and immediately failed multivariable calc.

I've always had an interest in music theory. 
There's not really such a think as "painting theory" or "movie theory". 
Our enjoyment of those things is too complicated to be easily described.

But music is comparatively very simple. 
It'd be hard to make a movie that only used three colors, each shown one at a time.
But you can make something that sounds recognizably like music with just three sine waves. 

Although I should mention that just because music theory is comparatively simple, doesn't mean it's easy. 
I've always loved this opening sentence from the paper ["Why Topology?"](https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/whytopology.pdf):

> Geometrical music theory models n-voice chords as points in a generalized donut, a twisted, mirrored, higher-dimensional orbifold that is difficult to visualize and understand.

But my lack of math knowledge wasn't the only thing between me and music theory.
It's pretty hard to learn music theory if you can't read sheet music! 
So I bought a piano keyboard and started learning.

It was not at all what I expected. 
After only about three months of practicing, I could *feel* the music coming out of my fingers. 
It doesn't sound like the music I listen to on the radio, but it *feels like music*, and it's coming out of me.

It's one of the most profound feelings I've ever had. 
(I know it sounds silly to say.) 
I knew I could do math and programming, but I didn't know I could make music.

It makes me wonder what other things I could do if I tried.
Maybe I should try learning calc again?
